# InfluxDB exporter

Download records from the InfluxDB API and write the output to a file
following the line-protocol specifications: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.2/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/

# Caveats

Really early-stage for now:

* everythig is hardcoded
* loosing precsion on timestamps, converting from micro to miliseconds
* can only extract one particular measurement over time from a particular DB
